<!-- Simple Whrrl To Do App Interview API -->

# To-Do API
* This API is suited with features such as searching sorting, filtering pagination, and able to do CRUD Ops. A base starter for all my apps.

## Getting Started.
1. Ensure Node 14^ is installed before cloning this app.

1. After cloning this app to your local repository, create a .env file in the root directory and clone the sample.env.local file with required dependencies such as DB URI String.

1. Navigate in to the app's root directory and run.
```sh

    yarn // to install all dependencies
    yarn start or yarn run dev // to run the server in development mode.

```

1. The server should be up and running. Happy Hacking :D
